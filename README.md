# CMIP5-qgrid
Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of qgrid for data exploration in the Pangeo google cloud CMIP6 data collection

We are having a lot of problems using [Qqrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) on our newer kernels

Note, to add qgrid to your own JupyterLab/Hub kernel, see `Qgrid` [readthedocs](https://qgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or
the following should work if you are using conda:
- conda install -c conda-forge qgrid
- jupyter labextension install qgrid
- jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.0
